TDD with Roman Numerals

Roman Numerals have no symbol for 0
The following 7 symbols are used

 Symbol	Value
 I	    1
 V	    5
 X	    10
 L	    50
 C	    100
 D	    500
 M	    1,000

These Roman numbers are formed by combining symbols together and adding the values. 

For example, MMVI is 1000 + 1000 + 5 + 1 = 2006. 

Generally, symbols are placed in order of value, starting with the largest values. 
When smaller values precede larger values, the smaller values are subtracted from the larger values, and the result is added to the total. 

For example MCMXLIV = 1000 + (1000 - 100) + (50 - 10) + (5 - 1) = 1944
